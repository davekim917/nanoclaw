# Reviewer Prompt Template

Construct each reviewer's prompt using this template. Replace placeholders with actual values.

## Template

```
Review the following code changes as a {ROLE} reviewer.

## Your Focus Area

{FOCUS_DESCRIPTION}

## Review Criteria

{CRITERIA — extracted from docs.nanoclaw.dev pages relevant to this reviewer's domain. Do NOT use static criteria files.}

## The Diff

{FULL_DIFF}

## Changed File Contents

{FULL_FILE_CONTENTS — read each changed file in full}

## Project Context

{CLAUDE_MD_CONTENTS — if present, paste CLAUDE.md for project conventions}

## Research Protocol

Before flagging any unfamiliar library, API, or pattern, research it first using this chain:
1. `mcp__plugin_context7_context7__resolve-library-id` + `mcp__plugin_context7_context7__query-docs` — current library/framework docs (preferred, may fail due to rate limits)
2. `mcp__deepwiki__ask_question` — architecture docs for specific GitHub repos/dependencies (preferred, may fail due to rate limits). If insufficient, try `mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure` + `mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_contents`.
3. `mcp__exa__web_search_exa` — official docs and known pitfalls (mandatory — always run even if steps 1-2 succeed)
4. `mcp__exa__get_code_context_exa` — real usage patterns in public repos
5. `mcp__exa__web_search_advanced_exa` — filtered/recent results when needed

If steps 1-2 fail, record the failure in your output notes AND proceed immediately to step 3 (Exa), which is the mandatory floor. Do not flag something as wrong without verifying against current docs.

## Collaboration Protocol

Your teammates on this review: {LIST_OF_OTHER_REVIEWER_NAMES}

After completing your initial analysis:
1. Send your preliminary findings to each teammate via `SendMessage`
2. Wait for their findings
3. Cross-check: if a teammate flags something in your domain, confirm or challenge it
4. Resolve disagreements or duplicates through discussion (2 rounds max)
5. After collaboration, send your FINAL findings to the team lead (NOT the other reviewers)

## Output Format

For each finding:
- **Severity**: BUG (must fix) or SUGGESTION (nice to have)
- **File**: exact path
- **Line**: line number or range
- **Issue**: what is wrong
- **Fix**: what to do instead
- **Confidence**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

If no issues found in your domain, say so. Do not invent problems.
```

## Collaboration Convergence

Reviewers should complete collaboration within **2 rounds of messaging** (send findings → receive + respond → finalize). If disagreement persists after 2 rounds, include both perspectives in the final report and let the lead adjudicate.

## Lead Prompt (implicit — no separate agent)

The lead is the invoking Claude session. It:
1. Gathers the diff
2. Selects and spawns reviewers
3. Waits for final findings from all reviewers
4. Deduplicates, classifies, and produces the combined report
5. Shuts down the team
